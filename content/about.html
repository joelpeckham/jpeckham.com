<p>
    I'm a software developer and (previously) a graphic designer. I'm currently
    located in Laramie, Wyoming and loving life! I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science
    from Southern Adventist Univeristy in May, 2022. When I'm not coding, I'm probably
    probably outside hiking, rock climbing or skiing. Professionally, I'm looking for a
    full-time position as a software developer. I'm very interested in AI and machine learning, 
    but I'm also open to other opportunities.
